MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for efficient deep learning inference on mobile and embedded devices. It serves as an ideal backbone network for object detection tasks, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Key Features:
Efficient Architecture: MobileNetV2 introduces inverted residual blocks and linear bottlenecks to optimize computational resources, allowing for efficient feature extraction.

Inverted Residuals: Lightweight depthwise convolutions followed by pointwise convolutions with a bottleneck layer enable more efficient use of computational resources.

Linear Bottlenecks: By employing linear activations in bottleneck layers, MobileNetV2 reduces computational cost and improves gradient flow during training.

Width Multiplier and Resolution Multiplier: These hyperparameters offer flexibility to adjust the model's size and computational complexity according to the requirements of the target device or application.
